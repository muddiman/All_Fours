### About the Game

Written in Javascript
Intend to port it to Python (using pygame). As code base grows, I intend to separate the code into conceptual
category, the libraries, for graphics, AI, etc and the user interface. Such that the graphics can be upgraded easily
without a rewrite of the game functionality. Features can be added, new rules implemented, in a modular way.
The game lacks any animation intentionally. Because this card game is particularly complex, I wanted to have a fully functional card game be i add the "bells & whistles" like animation and sound. To keep
bandwidth to a minimum I would try to use HTML Canvas exclusive for graphics and animation.
